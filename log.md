# Lerning Log

### Day 1: Jan 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Git pull-requests, using git through the terminal, var vs let in JS, and unit testing. 

**Thoughts:** I haven't quite figured out why so many people prefer using the terminal for git, when they could use the desktop app, or do it directly through VS Code. 

I want try using unit tests on my homework projects for CS 3270. I want to make it so I don't have to start at the beginning of my program each time to debug. (Skip all the user inputs)
